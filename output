hey jude don't make it bad ,
take a sad song and make it better 
remember to let her into your heart 
then you can start to make it better 

hey jude don't be afraid ,
You were made to go out and get her 
remember to let her under your skin 
then you will begin to make it better 

And anytime you feel the pain, hey jude, refrain, 
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders. 
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder. 

hey jude don't let me down ,
You have found her, now go and get her 
remember to let her into your heart 
then you can start to make it better 

So let it out and let it in, hey jude, begin,
Youre waiting for someone to perform with.
And don't you know that it's just you, hey jude, you'll do,
The movement you need is on your shoulder.

hey jude don't make it bad ,
take a sad song and make it better 
remember to let her into your heart 
then you can start to make it better 

Better better better better better better, oh 
Na na na na na, na na na
